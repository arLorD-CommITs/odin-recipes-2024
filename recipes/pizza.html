    <h2>Pizza Crust Ingredients</h2>
    <p>You need just five ingredients (plus some warm water) to make this super simple pizza crust.</p>

        <h4>Yeast</h4>
        <p>Active dry yeast is a leavening agent, which means it's the ingredient that causes the pizza dough to rise.
        </p>

        <h4>Sugar</h4>
        <p>To activate your yeast, you'll need to dissolve it in warm water with a teaspoon of sugar. The sugar gives the yeast something to eat and speeds up the <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/article/how-to-proof-yeast/">activation process</a>. You'll know your yeast is active when it becomes bubbly and frothy on top.

        <h4>Bread Flour</h4>
        <p><a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/article/difference-between-bread-flour-and-all-purpose-flour/">Bread flour</a> is ideal for pizza crust becauseit creates chewier results than all-purpose flour. This is because it contains more protein, which helps produce lots of gluten. Gluten is what gives the crust elasticity.</p>

        <h4>Olive Oil</h4>
        <p>Olive oil serves a couple purposes when it comes to pizza crust: Not only does it add color and flavor, but it creates a barrier between the oil and water. This oily barrier prevents sogginess.</p>

        <h4>Salt</h4>
        <p>A little bit of salt goes a long way. Salt adds flavor, strengthens the gluten (creating a chewier crust), and slows down fermentation (resulting in a better rise).

    <h2>How to Roll Out Pizza Dough
    </h2>
    <p>
        Stretching pizza dough is the most hands-on part of the pizza crust-making process. It takes a little practice, but it's as easy as pie (pun intended). To shape the dough:
    </p>

    <h3>Let the Dough Come to Room Temperature
    </h3>

    <p>After you're finished mixing the ingredients, allow your dough to rest on the counter for about 5 minutes. This will allow the gluten to relax, making the dough much easier to stretch and shape.
    </p>

    <h3>Prepare Your Surface With Oil
    </h3>
    <p>You might feel inclined to prep your workspace with a big handful of flour to prevent sticking. This is a helpful step with many kinds of dough. However, in this case, too much flour can make your pizza crust tough. Instead, rub your surface (and your hands) with a few tablespoons of olive oil and maybe a little bit of flour. This will prevent sticking, encourage a crispy texture, and ensure a gorgeous golden color.

    </p>

    <h3>Shape the Dough
    </h3>
    <p>You have a few options when it comes to shaping the dough. Stretch it in the air, use a rolling pin, or pat it with your hands. No matter which method you choose, make sure not to overwork the dough. Working it too much will create a tough texture. When you're done, you should have an even circle that's about 10 to 12 inches wide and about ⅓-inch thick. If you get too thin, the crust may not be able to support the sauce and toppings.
